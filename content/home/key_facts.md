**1 Papers and Poster Presentations**

The format of the **panels** will be as follows:
- Two paper presentations (max. 20mins)
- Comments from a distinguished scholar (10mins)

The format of the **posters** will be as follows:
- Please condense all you have on one single page of small written Power Point.
- Convert your power point into a .pdf.

**2 The Conference Venue**

We will meet for the conference on [gather.town](https://gather.town).

**IMPORTANT**: You will need an access code to enter the conference venue. Please make sure to register above so that we can reach out to you with the necessary details.

Gather.town is a tool for getting to both explore and chat with other people.

*What you need*:
- A desktop/laptop with a mic and camera.
- A web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended). We strongly recommend using headphones to help prevent feedback.

*How it works*:
- Gather is a video chat platform that has avatars move around a map. As you get close to other avatars, your videos will pop up and you will be able to chat.
- Move around the space using the arrow keys.
- By moving your avatar around you can have spontaneous conversations with those around you. These can be either one-on-one or small groups depending on how many people are around your avatar.
- When your avatar moves closer to an interactable object, it will glow yellow and there will be a notification that shows up saying ‘Press x to interact with -object-’. This can range from informational flyers to integrated Zoom meetings, and more!


Our conference venue will be live from Wednesday March 17th in case you want to try it out a little earlier.

For the panels themselves we will use Zoom. You will be able to access the Zoom panels via gather.town.

One year into the pandemic, the Zoom netiquette is certainly all too familiar for us.
- Please switch on the camera if you can.
- Please switch off the microphone when joining the meeting and whenever you are not talking.
- Please raise your hand when you want to talk. You can also use the chatbox if you prefer.



**3 Social Events During PolMeth Europe**

To further the community building, we also envisioned social events during the conference.

*polmeth::rejuvenate(paper)*

A lot of us have papers on which we already worked for maybe already a couple of weeks or even months. At one point, however, the project came to an end. Not because it was particularly bad, but more important things came along that crowded out our attention for the project. A considerable time already went into this research project, which means there are sunk costs. It is a pity that these papers are dormant in our drawers. What if someone came along who thinks that this project is worth a fresh look and would help you realise it?

At PolMeth, we want to create a market where people can meet to unearth the sunk costs in these projects. We want match those who have a project with those who might have an interest in restarting it. In our virtual conference space, there will be a large poster where you can post your paper projects. Other participants can read the abstracts and signal interest in a particular project. That way, the original author knows whether there is any interest from others to follow up and can decide to reach out to potential co-authors to keep working on things.

In case you are interested to participate, please send us via email the abstract of your dormant paper that you have already been working on until *March 12th*. We will then add it to the mural with the paper proposals.

We are keen to see this initiative at work and are looking for a dedicated group of peers to take this idea even further. Why not establishing such a paper market place at a larger scale? If you want to discuss how to develop this market place, meet me (Chris Arnold) anywhere in the conference space.

*Feedback Murals*

At a first conference of what has to ambition of becoming one of many, feedback is crucial to adapt the format to the need of participants. Does the workshop meet all expectations? What worked well? Where is room for improvement?

In addition, researchers also very often have good ideas about things that would be awesome to do or engage in beyond just the academic event. Think of all kind of infrastructures, platforms, discussions, software, data et cetera that such a PolMeth Europe community could create and benefit from. We want to give a space to all these ideas that might be in the back of your mind. Please find a virtual mural at the central plaza on gather.town where you can leave your feedback.

*Social Events on Gather.Town*

The platform itself is a great place to socialise. Always feel free to hang out there before and after the main events. We are also planning a special event on Friday evening once all panels are over.
