We are eager to facilitate an exciting and productive conference that is at the same time also an enjoyable social event. At a conference we expose our new ideas to a larger audience of colleagues which is always a leap of faith. As organisers of the conference, we formulated a mission statement that reflects our values and summarises the spirit of the event we imagine.

>We appreciate the contribution of each participant and are curious about what they are proposing. Our comments intend to help improve their work. In offering feedback, we are mindful that we all have different personal backgrounds and different academic upbringings. We consider our diversity to be one of our core assets. Our different viewpoints ultimately help further our joint goal: better science.
