**PolMeth is coming to Europe**

We are pleased to call for proposals for the first virtual PolMeth Europe Meeting between March 17th and March 19th 2021, hosted by the University of Hamburg. The deadline for proposals is December 18th 2020.

Recent data driven and technological advances have a deep impact on Society, Research and Development and therefore also Political Science. New data and new tools revolutionize what we can do with empirical analyses.

Even during the pandemic we want to allow for closer networking among data driven Political Scientists on the old continent, and decided to host a first virtual PolMeth Europe Meeting from March 17th to March 19th 2021.

It is our goal to bring together junior and senior scholars with a sweet tooth for innovative research methods and their applications. We work to the best of our abilities to offer a high quality virtual conference experience. Overall, the conference follows the well-established PolMeth format: Faculty have the opportunity to present papers and receive in-depth feedback. PhD students are invited to contribute posters, with ample opportunity for input from more senior colleagues. We welcome proposals that focus on methodological innovations as well as those that apply cutting-edge methods to empirical problems of substantive interest. We also will have two keynotes from significant scholars in political methodology.

Eager to actively build a vibrant community of enthusiastic methodologists, we extend the strict conference format with a series of new virtual social, mentoring, and networking activities. 

We encourage submissions that reflect the diversity of the profession. Aware that our impact as a subfield comes through embracing this diversity, we actively seek and welcome people with diverse backgrounds, experiences, and identities.

Please submit your paper and poster proposals including a title and an abstract (max 500 words) until December 18th 2020 [here](mailto:polmeth-europe@protonmail.com?subject=PolMeth Europe 2021 - Proposal&body=Dear PolMeth Europe Team, %0D%0A %0D%0A I want to submit the following proposal. %0D%0A %0D%0A Authors: %0D%0A %0D%0A Title: %0D%0A %0D%0A Abstract (max 500 words): %0D%0A %0D%0A Best, %0D%0A).

If you have any questions please contact the local organizer, Vera E. Tr√∂ger by email: [vera.eva.troeger@uni-hamburg.de](mailto:vera.eva.troeger@uni-hamburg.de).

We are looking forward to receiving your submissions.
